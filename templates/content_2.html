            A divide and conquer algorithm is a strategy of solving a large problem by
            <br><br>
1. breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems
2. solving the sub-problems, and
3. combining them to get the desired output.
<br><br>
The divide and conquer approach divides a problem into smaller subproblems; these subproblems are further solved recursively. The result of each subproblem is not stored for future reference, whereas, in a dynamic approach, the result of each subproblem is stored for future reference.
<br><br>
Use the divide and conquer approach when the same subproblem is not solved multiple times. Use the dynamic approach when the result of a subproblem is to be used multiple times in the future.
<br><br>
Divide and Conquer Applications:
 - Binary Search
 - Merge Sort
 - Quick Sort
 - Strassen's Matrix multiplication
 - Karatsuba Algorithm
